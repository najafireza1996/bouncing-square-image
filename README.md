# bouncing-square-image

Create a flutter app that contains a square in the middle containing an image. The square starts to move
in the direction of the first swipe and keeps bouncing off the walls of the page. The direction of the
movement can be changed with further swipes. If the square is clicked at any point while moving, the
image changes to another random image which should be loaded from the internet.
